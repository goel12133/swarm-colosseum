# Progress

## Plan (written before building)

Build order, following the brief: rules + engine with tests, then bots, then tournament,
then viewer, then the balance pass.

1. **`colosseum/rules.py`** — Season 0 constants in one place, as a dataclass so a test can
   build a modified ruleset (e.g. pk forced to 1.0) without touching globals.
2. **`colosseum/policy.py`** — load a bot from a file path as a *fresh module instance per
   match*, and wrap `act()` so any exception or malformed action becomes a no-op and a
   counter, never a crash.
3. **`colosseum/sim.py`** — the tick loop with a fixed, documented order of operations. One
   seeded RNG per match; every random draw made in sorted-id order so the same
   (attacker, defender, seed) is byte-identical.
4. **Tests** alongside, not after: determinism, resource limits, ID masking, blast kills,
   impact damage, a bot that always raises, the scoring formula against a hand calculation.
5. **Bots**: 5 attackers, 4 defenders, each with a docstring naming the idea it tests.
6. **`tournament.py` + `elo.py`** — round robin over seeds, two ladders, deterministic
   match order, writes `out/leaderboard.json`, `out/matrix.json`, `out/replays/`,
   `out/BALANCE.md`.
7. **`viewer/index.html`** — single file, canvas, file picker + drag-and-drop + one embedded
   sample replay, light/dark, phone width.
8. **Balance pass** — run, check the >90% bot / >85% role thresholds, tune only `rules.py`,
   at most 3 iterations, each change and its reason recorded here and in BALANCE.md.

### Decisions I am making up front (flagging, not deviating silently)

- **Track id = drone id.** The brief has the defender intercepting `track_id` and the
  attacker owning `drone.id`; one stable identifier keeps replays readable. A track only
  exists while the drone is inside radar range.
- **Guidance and fuse.** Lead pursuit uses the *noisy* estimate, as specified. The
  proximity fuse detonates on the assigned target only; an interceptor that coasts past an
  unrelated drone does not spontaneously detonate. Otherwise "if its target dies it keeps
  coasting" has no stable meaning.
- **`random.normalvariate`, not `random.gauss`.** `gauss` caches a spare value between
  calls, which makes the draw sequence depend on call history. `normalvariate` does not.
- Every random draw is made iterating ids in sorted order, so determinism does not depend
  on dict insertion order.
